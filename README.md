# Number Mind
Number Mind is a HackerRank problem found here: https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler185/problem

I've used Genetic Algorithm (GA) to approach the solution.

Using the sample input found on Hackerrank; the solution is found in about half a second on avergare. The major improvement in runtime came by eliminating incorrect digits from the candidate string. Incorrect digits (that is, incorrect at a specific position in the string) are supplied by the input as indicated by '0' correct digits.
