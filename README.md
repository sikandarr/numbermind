# Number Mind
Number Mind is a HackerRank problem found here: https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler185/problem

I've used Genetic Algorithm (GA) to approach the solution.

Using the sample input found on Hackerrank; the solution is found in around 30 seconds in a best case scenario and may take upto 10 minutes or longer in some cases.
